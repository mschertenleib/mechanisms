# mechanisms

This project is developed as a personal learning tool for the implementation of
stress-strain FEA, topology optimization, and other topics related to
compliant and rigid mechanisms.

## Build

All dependencies are handled
by [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake).

```
git clone https://github.com/mschertenleib/mechanisms.git
cd mechanisms
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target mechanisms
```

## Dependencies

- [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen)
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [Implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot)

## Notes

- `EIGEN_NO_AUTOMATIC_RESIZING` apparently breaks some operations. For example,
  when a default-constructed dense `dst` is assigned a sparse `src`, the
  fundamental operations executed are:
  ```
  dst._resize_to_match(src);
  dst.setZero();
  resize_if_allowed(dst, src);
  for each coeff in non-zeros of src:
      dst(coeff.index) = coeff.value;
  ```
  If `EIGEN_NO_AUTOMATIC_RESIZING` is defined, `dst._resize_to_match(src)` is a
  no-op **even if `dst` has size 0**, and the call to `setZero()` does nothing
  (because `dst` still has size 0). Then `resize_if_allowed(dst, src)` actually
  resizes `dst` to the size of `src`, and leaves its coefficients uninitialized.
  Therefore only the coefficients corresponding to non-zeros of `src` are
  assigned to, while the others keep their uninitialized value (NaN
  if `EIGEN_INITIALIZE_MATRICES_BY_NAN` is defined).

  If `EIGEN_NO_AUTOMATIC_RESIZING` is not defined, the resizing of `dst` happens
  in `dst._resize_to_match(src)`, **before** the `setZero()`, and everything
  works as expected.
